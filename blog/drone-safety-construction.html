        <h2>Why Safety Matters More Than Ever</h2>
        <p>
            Construction sites are some of the most hazardous work environments. From unstable structures to 
            high-risk inspections, workers face dangers every day. Modern drone technology gives construction 
            teams a safer way to monitor job sites, access difficult areas, and gather real-time data without 
            putting workers in harm’s way.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Drones Reduce Risk During Inspections</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional inspections often require climbing scaffolding, walking across unfinished rooftops, 
            or accessing tight, unstable areas. Drones eliminate these risks by performing aerial inspections 
            quickly and safely. High-resolution cameras capture every detail from a distance, keeping workers 
            on the ground and out of danger.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Real-Time Monitoring Improves On-Site Awareness</h2>
        <p>
            Construction managers can use drones to monitor job sites in real time, identifying unsafe 
            behavior, equipment hazards, or structural issues immediately. Having an instant overhead view 
            allows supervisors to respond faster and maintain a safer work environment for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Better Documentation Helps Prevent Future Accidents</h2>
        <p>
            Drones provide clear photo and video documentation of a site’s progress and condition. This data 
            helps safety teams analyze incidents, improve training, and create safer procedures for future 
            projects. Having accurate visual records is invaluable for risk management.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Accessing Hard-to-Reach Areas Safely</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of sending workers into confined spaces or elevated positions, drones can hover, inspect, 
            and capture footage with ease. This reduces the chance of falls, collapses, or exposure to 
            hazardous materials.
        </p>

        <h2>How DJI Drones Support Construction Safety</h2>
        <p>
            DJI offers advanced flight stability, long battery life, and high-resolution sensors designed 
            for industrial inspections. Models like the Mavic 3 Pro, Air 3S, and Inspire 3 give construction 
            teams the precision and reliability needed for safe on-site operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether it’s site monitoring, hazard detection, or detailed inspections, DJI’s ecosystem of 
            drones and accessories helps construction companies work safer, smarter, and more efficiently.
        </p>

        <h2>A Safer Future for Construction Teams</h2>
        <p>
            Drone technology continues to change the construction industry by reducing on-site risks, 
            improving inspection workflows, and protecting workers. As these tools become more widely adopted, 
            construction sites will become safer and more efficient than ever.
