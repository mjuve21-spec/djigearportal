      <p>
        Thermal imaging used to be limited to handheld cameras and expensive, slow inspections.
        Today, DJI drones equipped with thermal sensors allow construction teams to scan large
        areas quickly and identify hidden issues that are impossible to see with the naked eye.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Detecting Heat Loss and Insulation Problems</h2>
      <p>
        On building envelopes, thermal drones can highlight areas where heat is escaping through
        walls, roofs, or windows. This helps contractors and owners verify insulation work,
        identify gaps, and improve overall energy performance of the structure.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Finding Moisture and Water Intrusion</h2>
      <p>
        Moisture trapped in roofing systems or walls often shows up as temperature differences in
        thermal images. Drones can scan large surfaces from the air, revealing potential leaks or
        hidden moisture before it causes serious damage.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Checking Electrical and Mechanical Systems</h2>
      <p>
        Overheated electrical components, overloaded circuits, or mechanical failures can appear as
        hot spots on thermal imagery. Drones make it easier to inspect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rooftop HVAC units</li>
        <li>Exterior electrical cabinets</li>
        <li>Exposed conduit, transformers, and panels</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These inspections can be performed without ladders or roof access, reducing risk for crews.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Verifying Concrete Curing and Surface Temperatures</h2>
      <p>
        Temperature patterns on large concrete pours can reveal curing inconsistencies or
        differences in material behavior. Thermal drones help teams monitor surface conditions
        over time and flag areas that may require closer inspection.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Night and Low-Light Inspections</h2>
      <p>
        Because thermal sensors detect heat rather than visible light, they can be used in
        low-light or nighttime conditions when standard cameras struggle. This is helpful when
        work must be verified outside normal daylight hours.
      </p>

      <h2>Recommended DJI Platforms for Thermal Inspections</h2>
      <p>
        Several DJI platforms support thermal payloads or integrated thermal cameras. Depending on
        project size and budget, teams may choose:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Enterprise-class drones</strong> with built-in thermal sensors for professional inspections.</li>
        <li><strong>Modular payload systems</strong> that allow switching between visual and thermal cameras.</li>
        <li><strong>Compact models</strong> suitable for basic heat-loss checks and small-site work.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safer, Smarter Inspections from the Air</h2>
      <p>
        Thermal drone inspections reduce the need for scaffolding, lifts, or rooftop walks. By
        capturing both visual and thermal imagery from the air, construction teams can see more,
        work safer, and make better decisions about repairs, maintenance, and energy performance.
